# Instructions  

  ## Questions
  1. Create a function called compareSearch(int[] array, int number) that searches an array for a number.
  
  Your function should:
  
  Search for the number using both a sequential search and a binary search.</br>
  Return how many loops your searches took to find the given number for each search in an integer array.</br>
  Index 0 of the array is the sequential number of loops and index 1 of the array is the binary number of loops.
  
  2. Create another function called compareStringSearch(String[] array, String word) that searches an array for a word.
  Your program should do the exact same actions as question 1 but on Strings instead of integers.
